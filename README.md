Hallowed End Modification for Terraria (Developed with tAPI)

This is a modification that adds new weapons, armor, NPCs, and a wide variety of customizations that we felt were missing from the original game.

This is the official source code for the mod. This mod currently compiles with tAPI r6. I will try to keep this source code up to date with the API updates as necessary.

Inside the ModReleases folder you will find the latest built version of the mod (.tapi format) if you'd like to just download the mod and get playing, this is the quickest route to do so.

Branches: 
* Master: Contains the current official version of the mod release and is the most stable version of the modification.
* Development: Contains all stable work in progress for the mod, this will contain all of the newest additions to the mod, while not being 100% stable.
* Side Branches: Contains individual working elements that will likely be merged into development once completed
